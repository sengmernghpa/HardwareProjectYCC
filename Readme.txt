Something is not right with network. You ping 192.168.2.110 and it answers once, then all of a sudden it starts to ping 192.168.2.103... I guess the most obvious thing to ask is 1. Are both devices in same range (192.168.2.x). I mean the Pi and you laptop. Have you used raspi-config to make sure ssh is enabled (its under advanced. Or you can sudo service ssh status – geoffmcc Feb 1 '15 at 14:54
